<p>VPNs, SSH reverse tunnels, <del>Syngergy</del> -&gt; <del>Barrier</del> -&gt; Input Leap, KVMs. I&rsquo;ve dodged using the Mac for nearly eight years, but now I have to give in.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">WARNING</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">This post might seem obvious to many macOS users.</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Coming from the Linux world of personal computers and having used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">tiling windows managers</a> for a while now, I always struggle with using Mac OS at work. I don&rsquo;t like it a single bit. I hate inability of solving problems, the lack of customization and control you have over the OS. But if there&rsquo;s one thing that I hate the most is the fact that, as an user, one must forfeit to Apple&rsquo;s concept of what a good UX is and not the other way around. Having the chance to bring the UX closer to the individual, while maintaining a usable software for the herd, is something they just don&rsquo;t care and I don&rsquo;t blame them. Nevertheless, there are some things I have done to try to make my experience better.</p>
<h2 id="the-windows">The windows</h2>
<p>Even if not really tiling, windows can be arranged side by side using only your keyboard with a third party app. There are a bunch of applications: <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai">Yabai</a>, <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a>, <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/">Rectangle</a>, etc. I&rsquo;m currently using Rectangle since it just does windows arrangements using native floating windows and you can also set up key combinations to achieve this.</p>
<p>Moving through desktops can be both configured under the Mission Control settings (<code>Settings &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keybaord Shortcuts &gt; Missions Control</code>), but it&rsquo;s limited to 4 Desktops. Cycling through Desktops (workspaces) keybindings can also be changed from here.</p>
<p>Changing focus is somethings that I have gave up to do with the keyboard. There are some commands and binaries you can install to achieve a somewhat decent experience, but as Žižek says, <em>I would prefer not to</em>. I just pick up the mouse and <strong>CLICK</strong> the window, since putting the cursor over won&rsquo;t focus on it (something that I have also resign to set up). I&rsquo;m okay with switching focus within the active and last-active window, a shortcut for this can be set up on <code>Settings &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keybaord Shortcuts &gt; Keyboard</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-cmdctrl-inferno">The Cmd/Ctrl inferno</h2>
<p>Among all the lack of standards and custom keys the Mac OS has, the thing that bothers me the most here is the <strong>Copy/Paste/Cut</strong> that I&rsquo;m used to do with <code>Ctrl + C</code>,  <code>Ctrl + V</code> and  <code>Ctrl + X</code>. In Mac one would have to switch the <code>Ctrl</code> key for the <code>Cmd</code> key for many things, <strong>BUT NOT FOR EVERYTHING</strong>. For this, I have found that OS X let&rsquo;s you override <em>keyboard shortcuts</em>. This also works to override more than one keyboard shortcut that is set to the <strong>Command</strong> key rather than the <strong>Control</strong> key.</p>
<p>To access, navigate to <code>Settings &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keybaord Shortcuts &gt; App Shortcuts</code></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/mac_setup0.jpg" alt="ShortcutsSettings"></p>
<p>Shortcuts can be override for <em>All Applications</em> or for custom applications.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Menu Title&rdquo; refers to Mac&rsquo;s menu name displayed at the top bar for each windows.</p>
<p>For instance, &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; would be the name of our Menu Title and the <code>^V</code> means that I have remapped this to <code>Ctrl + V</code>.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td><img src="/images/posts/mac_setup1.jpg" alt="MenuTitle"></td>
          <td><img src="/images/posts/mac_setup2.jpg" alt="MenuTitle2"></td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Bare in mind that these Menu Titles might change with updates from each application and you should always.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of some keyboard shortcuts I have set up:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Menu Title            </th>
          <th>Combination            </th>
          <th>Application            </th>
          <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Paste</td>
          <td>Ctrl+V</td>
          <td>All Applicationws</td>
          <td>Paste</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Cut</td>
          <td>Ctrl+X</td>
          <td>All Applications</td>
          <td>Cut</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Copy</td>
          <td>Ctrl+C</td>
          <td>All Applications</td>
          <td>Copy</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>New Tab</td>
          <td>Ctrl+T</td>
          <td>Chrome</td>
          <td>Opens a new Tab</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Close Tab</td>
          <td>Ctrl+W</td>
          <td>Chrome</td>
          <td>Closes a new Tab</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Reload This Page</td>
          <td>Ctrl+W</td>
          <td>Chrome</td>
          <td>Reloads Page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Find&hellip;</td>
          <td>Ctrl+F</td>
          <td>Chrome</td>
          <td>Reloads Page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Paste</td>
          <td>Ctrl+Shift+V</td>
          <td>iTerm</td>
          <td>Paste on terminal</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Open Location&hellip;</td>
          <td>Ctrl+L</td>
          <td>Chrome</td>
          <td>Cursor to the URL bar</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>&hellip;</td>
          <td>&hellip;</td>
          <td>&hellip;</td>
          <td>&hellip;</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Additionally, changing things like <em>Taking screenshots</em> and Spotlight can be achieve in the same settings: <code>Settings &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keybaord Shortcuts &gt; ...</code></p>
<h2 id="brew">Brew</h2>
<p>There are some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26036834">discussions</a> on weather Brew is good or bad. In my case, I had better experiences with other package managers but I&rsquo;ve never really had the motivation to learn it properly. However, for many tasks, <a href="https://ports.macports.org/">Mac Ports</a> has caused me less issues.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-through-text-soon">Navigating through text (soon..)</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t quite solved this yet, but once I do, I&rsquo;ll write a second part of this post. However, I do have an idea on how to tackle it.</p>
<p>Skipping through words is something i do a lot both for <strong>moving the cursor</strong> around or <strong>selecting chunks of sentences</strong>. I use <code>Ctrl + Left/Right</code> but on OS X it&rsquo;s default is <code>Option + Left/Right</code>.This shortcut can be overridden in iTerm, for example, but not system-wide. Unfortunately, other key combinations such as <code>Ctrl + A</code> for selecting all text under the cursor, are also done using the <code>Option</code> key. I have found that functions as such are mapped to send escape sequence like <code>^[[1;5D</code>. Luckily I have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QMK">qmk</a> compatible <a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd">keyboard</a> that lets me send escape characters for a determine key combination, I&rsquo;m trying to achieve a seamless experiences regardless of the OS you are using, but I&rsquo;m not there yet.</p>
