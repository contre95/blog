      <description>What initially were supposed to be 370 km on the bike ended up being less than half. However, it wasnâ€™t easy and was even somewhat dangerous. We were accompanied by two sturdy bikes, a Giant and a Trek, both loaded on either side with clothes, food, and a tent, and they managed to handle dirt, mountains, and roads. The trains in Germany were a great help, both to avoid descents rated as &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; on Komoot and to dodge 12 mm of rain one night.</description>

      <description>GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard and this is just part 0 of who knows how many series where I will explain my basic understanding of GPG and how useful is on my daily basis.
