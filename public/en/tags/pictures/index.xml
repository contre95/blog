      <description>What initially were supposed to be 370 km on the bike ended up being less than half. However, it wasnâ€™t easy and was even somewhat dangerous. We were accompanied by two sturdy bikes, a Giant and a Trek, both loaded on either side with clothes, food, and a tent, and they managed to handle dirt, mountains, and roads. The trains in Germany were a great help, both to avoid descents rated as &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; on Komoot and to dodge 12 mm of rain one night.</description>
